# Getting started

Phone Farm iOS drives physical iPhones from a local dashboard: guided device
registration, a live screen with remote tap/swipe, and a PostgreSQL‑backed
scheduler that runs versioned automation tasks (TikTok and Instagram plugins
ship built‑in).

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| macOS + Xcode | Real‑device builds and signing. `xcode-select -p` must point at an Xcode install, not the Command Line Tools. |
| Node.js 22+ | `engines.node >= 22`. The app runs TypeScript directly through `tsx`; there is no build step for the server. |
| PostgreSQL 14+ | `docker compose up -d postgres` is provided, or bring your own and set `DATABASE_URL`. |
| A physical iPhone | Developer‑enabled, trusted, connected by USB. |
| An Apple Developer team | For signing WebDriverAgent. |

## 1. Xcode & first device pairing

Everything downstream — signing WebDriverAgent, launching it as a UI test,
the registration wizard's checks — assumes Xcode can already **see and sign
for** the iPhone. Do this once, before touching the repo:

1. **Install the full Xcode** from the App Store (not just the Command Line
   Tools), open it once, and accept the licence:
   ```sh
   sudo xcodebuild -license accept
   sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```
   `xcode-select -p` must now print `…/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.

2. **Add your Apple ID** in Xcode → Settings → Accounts. Select the team and
   note its **Team ID** (the 10-character string) — that's `XCODE_ORG_ID`
   in step 3. A free personal team works for a single device; a paid team is
   needed for more than one, and for the device list not to expire weekly.

3. **Pair the iPhone.** Connect it by USB, unlock it, tap **Trust This
   Computer**, enter the passcode. In Xcode → Window → **Devices and
   Simulators**, the device should appear and, after a minute, read
   **"Connected"** (not "Preparing" or "Unavailable") — Xcode is downloading
   the matching Developer Disk Image in the background.

4. **Enable Developer Mode** (iOS 16+): on the phone, Settings → Privacy &
   Security → **Developer Mode** → on → restart → confirm. If the toggle
   isn't there yet, it appears after the first pair with Xcode.

5. **Login keychain** — `wda:prepare` (step 5) signs with a certificate in
   your login keychain, which is only unlocked in a graphical session. Run it
   from Terminal.app / a remote desktop, not a bare SSH shell.

Verify the phone is visible to the toolchain:

```sh
xcrun xctrace list devices      # your iPhone must be under "Devices", not "Devices Offline"
```

## 2. Install

```sh
git clone <this-repo> phone-farm
cd phone-farm
npm install
npm run appium:install-driver     # installs the XCUITest driver into ./.appium2
```

## 3. Configure

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in at least:

| Key | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `IOS_PLATFORM_VERSION` | e.g. `17.5` — must match the device |
| `XCODE_ORG_ID` | Apple Development **Team ID** (Xcode → Settings → Accounts) |
| `WDA_BUNDLE_ID` | A bundle id you control, e.g. `com.yourorg.WebDriverAgentRunner` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://phone_farm:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/phone_farm` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Needed by `docker compose` if you use the bundled database |

You don't need to put a device UDID in `.env`. The CLI scripts and the
dashboard's registration wizard resolve the target device on their own; pass
`--udid <udid>` (or set `IOS_UDID`) only to pin a specific one. Device
passcodes stay out of `.env` too — see [devices & secrets](#devices-and-secrets).

## 4. Database

```sh
npm run db:up        # start the bundled Postgres (skip if you run your own)
npm run db:migrate   # apply scheduler + pg-boss schema
```

## 5. Build WebDriverAgent

```sh
npm run wda:prepare                 # the connected / sole registered device
npm run wda:prepare -- --udid <udid> # a specific device
npm run wda:prepare -- --all        # every device in devices.json
```

This patches the Appium‑bundled `appium-webdriveragent`, then runs
`xcodebuild build-for-testing` signed with your team, once per target device.
It ends with `** TEST BUILD SUCCEEDED **`.

> **Run this from a graphical login session** (Terminal.app, or a remote
> desktop), not a bare SSH shell. Code signing needs the login keychain
> unlocked; over SSH it fails with `errSecInternalComponent`. If you must run
> it over SSH: `security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db`
> and `security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign: -s -k <pw>
> ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db` first.

## 6. Run the four processes

Each is long‑lived. In development that's four terminals; for an always‑on host,
wrap each in a `launchd` agent (macOS) or systemd unit with your own process
manager — they need no arguments, just the repo as the working directory and
`.env` on the path.

```sh
npm run appium         # Appium 3 + XCUITest on :4725
npm run wda:service    # per-device WebDriverAgent supervisor (Unix socket + :8100+/:9100+)
npm run worker         # scheduler worker — runs due tasks
npm run web            # dashboard + API on :3000
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>, go to **Register device**, pick the connected
device, and step through the checks. Unlock the phone when WDA first launches.

## 7. Schedule something

From a device page you can run the built‑in TikTok and Instagram tasks
(`doomscroll`, `post`) now or on a `daily`/`weekly`/`once` schedule. Watch
progress in **Activity**; full logs are under `GET /api/executions/:id`.

## Authentication

On a loopback bind (`WEB_HOST=127.0.0.1`) auth is optional. Before binding to
anything else, set `PHONE_FARM_AUTH_PLUGIN` to an ESM module exporting an
`AuthProvider`; startup **deliberately fails** otherwise (`assertSafeBind`).
Write the provider against the `AuthProvider` interface in `src/plugin.ts` —
it hands you the Fastify instance to register login routes on, an
`authenticate(request)` hook, and `isPublicPath()` for the unauthenticated
allow‑list.

## Devices and secrets

Registered devices live in `devices.json` (git‑ignored):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Phone A",
    "udid": "00008030-000000000000000E",
    "wdaLocalPort": 8100,
    "mjpegLocalPort": 9100,
    "coordinateProfile": "iphone8",
    "passcode": "123456",
    "pluginData": {
      "com.git-agni.tiktok": { "accounts": ["@handle"] },
      "com.git-agni.instagram": { "accounts": ["@handle"] }
    }
  }
]
```

- `coordinateProfile` selects a compiled tap layout — see
  [coordinates.md](coordinates.md).
- `pluginData[<pluginId>]` is per‑device plugin config (never secrets).
- `disabled: true` keeps the entry but stops the farm supervising it — no
  WebDriverAgent, no scheduler worker, no discovery polling. Toggle it from the
  dashboard ("Disconnect" on a device card, "Reconnect" under **Disconnected
  devices**) or with `PATCH /api/devices/:udid` (`{"disabled":true}` /
  `{"disabled":false}`). Scheduling is rejected while a device is disabled.
- `passcode` is the device unlock code, used to wake a locked phone before
  automation. It lives here because `devices.json` is git‑ignored and written
  `0600`. It is **never** returned by the API — `GET /api/devices` reports
  `hasPasscode: true/false` instead. Set it in the registration wizard, with
  `PATCH /api/devices/:udid` (`{"passcode":"…"}`, `""` clears it), or by editing
  the file. `IOS_PASSCODE` / `IOS_PASSCODE_<UDID>` in the environment still work
  as a deprecated fallback.

## Health & troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `wda: error … stale or corrupted` | Re‑run `npm run wda:prepare`; delete `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/WebDriverAgent-*` if it keeps producing an empty `.app`. |
| `wda: unlock-required` | Physically unlock the iPhone once. |
| `Appium is unavailable on port 4725` | `npm run appium` not running, or a stale process on the port. |
| web returns 401 everywhere | An auth provider is configured — sign in, or unset `PHONE_FARM_AUTH_PLUGIN` on loopback. |
| `sh: appium: command not found` in an agent | Invoke via `node node_modules/appium/index.js …` if npm did not link the bin. |

`GET /health` lists the loaded plugins and versions. `wda:service`'s socket
has `/health` with per‑device state.
